# Rust JVM [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nerd2/rjvm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nerd2/rjvm)

This project aims to be a clean implementation of a Java Virtual Machine in Rust. It was initially started by Sam Lancia in order to learn more about Java byte code and to learn Rust.

### Prerequisites

An openjdk implementation of the Java runtime must be extracted into $BASE/javart for the library to operate. TODO: instructions on where to get this

### Installing

Currently the virtual machine is provided only as a library but we plan to implement a "java"-compatible frontend.

## Running the tests

  cargo test
